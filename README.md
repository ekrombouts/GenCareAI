# GenCareAI
An initiative to develop AI-driven nursing home care plans using fictional client data.

Welcome to the GenCareAI repository. 
This project is an initial step in exploring how NLP techniques can be used to automate the creation of care plans in nursing homes.

## Project overview
**Fictitious Data Creation:** We use OpenAI to create a realistic, yet entirely fictional, dataset of client records. This protects the privacy and upholds the ethical handling of sensitive patient data.

**LLM Finetuning:** The fictional dataset will be utilized to finetune an open-source Large Language Model (LLM). This process aims to customize the model for enhanced performance on specific tasks within the healthcare sector.

**Future Application to Real Data:** After the initial finetuning with fictitious data, we plan to adapt the model locally with actual client data, aiming to produce precise and personalized care plans.

## Goal of GenCareAI
GenCareAI aims to assist healthcare professionals in nursing homes by creating AI-driven tools that help reduce administrative tasks while maintaining the privacy and security of patient data.
