## Project overview
**Fictitious Data Creation:** We use OpenAI to create a realistic, yet entirely fictional, dataset of client records. This protects the privacy and upholds the ethical handling of sensitive patient data.

**LLM Finetuning:** The fictional dataset will be utilized to finetune an open-source Large Language Model (LLM). This process aims to customize the model for enhanced performance on specific tasks within the healthcare sector.

**Future Application to Real Data:** After the initial finetuning with fictitious data, we plan to adapt the model locally with actual client data, aiming to produce precise and personalized care plans.

## Goal of GenCareAI
GenCareAI aims to assist healthcare professionals in nursing homes by creating AI-driven tools that help reduce administrative tasks while maintaining the privacy and security of patient data.
