The goal is to add as much story and variation to the notes as possible, without letting the model produce outputs that are overly creative.  \n","To achieve this, I use structured prompts (to help the model understand the expected content and its creative liberties), example libraries and memory integration.  \n","The output parser uses Pydantic models to structure and validate the care notes, ensuring proper format and content.  \n","Chroma is used to retrieve example care notes that are representative of the client profile and scenario. \n","\n","The script processes client profiles and scenarios, generates care notes, and updates summaries accordingly, creating comprehensive client records.  \n","The goal is to create a diverse and realistic dataset for NLP experiments in nursing homes.\n","\n","**Please note** that generating data with OpenAI is not free.
